Our online life is real life. We walk, talk, work, LOL and even love on the Internet – but we don’t always treat it like real life. Host Manoush Zomorodi explores this disconnect with stories from the wilds of the Web, and gets to the bottom of online issues that affect us all. Whether it’s privacy breaches, closed platforms, hacking, fake news, or cyber bullying, we the people have the power to change the course of the Internet, keeping it ethical, safe, weird, and wonderful for everyone. IRL is an original podcast from Firefox, the tech company that believes privacy isn’t a policy. It’s a right.

## About Firefox

Firefox believes that privacy is a fundamental right, not just a feature buried in a menu bar. That’s why we put privacy first in everything we make, like services that help people find out if they were affected by a data breach, add-ons that block social media sites from following them around the web, and a browser that keeps your data safe, never sold. Firefox fights for your privacy and we’re backed by Mozilla – the not-for-profit organization working to make the web open and accessible to all.
