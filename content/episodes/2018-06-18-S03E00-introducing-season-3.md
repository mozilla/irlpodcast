transcript: |
    **Speaker 1:**  You know, there were nights where I would log off having essentially tricked women into going on dates. That was really difficult.

    **Speaker 2:** Yeah, I'm worried. I'm worried that stuff doesn't go away. They could sell my information, right? To Russians?

    **Speaker 3:** It's coming to a boil in the consumer consciousness.

    **Veronica Belmont:**  Our motto here on the IRL podcast is that online life is real life. Not just because most of us sleep with our phones, but also because the choices we make online affect our day to day lives more than ever before. Over our first two seasons, we confronted online trolls and stood up for net neutrality. We downloaded the latest on bots and facial recognition technology. We visited plenty of tech startups, and even a cult. Most importantly, we've connected with you. We're so grateful that you've joined us to help shape a stronger, more human internet for everybody.

    **Speaker 5:** As you come to understand what these platforms want from you, you're in a much better position to use them intelligently. It's not that scary.

    **Veronica Belmont:** In season three of IRL, we're going places we've never gone before. You'll find out what happened when the US Army got into the video game business, what it's like to be a professional flirter on Tinder, for real, and how a super cute pig transformed a person's life one Instagram post at a time. It's all leading up to a very special season finale, where we take everything we've learned and used it to try and predict the future of elections. I'm your host, Veronica Belmont, and this is season three of IRL, an original podcast from Mozilla. Episode one launches July 2nd. Subscribe via Apple podcasts or Spotify, or wherever you get your ear candy. It's easy and it's free. We can not wait to share it all with you.
